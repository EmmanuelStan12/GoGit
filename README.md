## Introduction

GoGit is a custom-built version control system designed to manage changes to source code and other files. This guide will walk you through implementing a version control system from basic functionalities to more advanced features.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- Go programming language installed.
- Basic knowledge of Go and version control systems.
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode, GoLand).

## Basic Implementation

### Initialization

**Objective**: Create a new repository.

- **Command**: `init`
- **Action**: Create a `.gogit` directory to store metadata and version control information.

**Steps**:
1. Create a command-line interface (CLI) using Go.
2. Implement the `init` command to initialize a new repository.

### Staging Area

**Objective**: Add changes to a staging area before committing.

- **Command**: `add <file>`
- **Action**: Track changes to files.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `add` command to stage files.
2. Store staged files in a separate area within `.gogit`.

### Committing Changes

**Objective**: Save the staged changes with a message.

- **Command**: `commit -m "<message>"`
- **Action**: Create a new commit with a unique ID.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `commit` command to save changes.
2. Store commit information in a log within `.gogit`.

### Branching

**Objective**: Create and switch between branches.

- **Command**: `branch <branch-name>`
- **Action**: Manage different lines of development.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `branch` command to create and switch branches.
2. Track branch information in `.gogit`.

### Merging

**Objective**: Merge changes from one branch into another.

- **Command**: `merge <branch-name>`
- **Action**: Combine changes from different branches.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `merge` command to combine branches.
2. Resolve conflicts if necessary.

### Logging

**Objective**: Display commit history.

- **Command**: `log`
- **Action**: Show the history of commits.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `log` command to display commit history.
2. Format output to show commit messages and timestamps.

## Advanced Features

### Networking

**Objective**: Synchronize changes with a remote repository.

- **Commands**: `push`, `pull`
- **Action**: Upload and download changes from/to a remote server.

**Steps**:
1. Implement networking protocols for `push` and `pull`.
2. Handle authentication and data transfer.

### Conflict Resolution

**Objective**: Resolve merge conflicts.

- **Action**: Handle conflicts manually or automatically.

**Steps**:
1. Implement conflict detection.
2. Provide tools for manual conflict resolution.

### Rebasing

**Objective**: Move or combine commits to a new base commit.

- **Command**: `rebase <branch-name>`
- **Action**: Reapply commits on top of another branch.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `rebase` command.
2. Handle commit reapplication and conflict resolution.

### Tagging

**Objective**: Create named points in the commit history.

- **Command**: `tag <tag-name>`
- **Action**: Mark specific commits with a tag.

**Steps**:
1. Implement the `tag` command.
2. Store tag information in `.gogit`.

## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Hashing

**Objective**: Create unique identifiers for commits.

- **Algorithm**: SHA-1 or SHA-256.

**Steps**:
1. Implement hashing for commit IDs.

### Trees and Graphs

**Objective**: Represent directories and commit history.

- **Data Structure**: Tree for files, DAG for commits.

**Steps**:
1. Implement tree structure for file directories.
2. Implement DAG for commit history.

### Diff and Patch Algorithms

**Objective**: Find and apply changes between files.

- **Algorithms**: Diff for changes, Patch for applying.

**Steps**:
1. Implement diff algorithm to find file differences.
2. Implement patch algorithm to apply changes.

### Concurrency and Networking

**Objective**: Handle concurrency and networking.

- **Tools**: Go goroutines, channels, HTTP protocols.

**Steps**:
1. Use Go’s concurrency primitives for handling multiple tasks.
2. Implement HTTP protocols for network operations.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup**
    - Initialize a Go project.
    - Set up CLI using a library like `cobra`.

2. **Repository Initialization**
    - Implement `init` command.

3. **Staging and Committing**
    - Implement `add` and `commit` commands.

4. **Branching and Merging**
    - Implement `branch` and `merge` commands.

5. **Logging**
    - Implement `log` command.

6. **Networking**
    - Implement `push` and `pull` commands.

7. **Testing and Documentation**
    - Write tests for each component.
    - Document usage and architecture.

## Testing and Documentation

1. **Testing**
    - Write unit and integration tests for each feature.
    - Use Go’s testing framework.

2. **Documentation**
    - Provide clear documentation on commands and usage.
    - Maintain updated README and API documentation.
